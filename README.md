# seng-event
Provides Classes and utilities for dispatching and listening to events.

Provides an _EventDispatcher_ base class that adds the ability to dispatch events and attach handlers that 
should be called when such events are triggered. New event classes can be created by extending the _AbstractEvent_
class provided in this module. This module also provides basic event classes _BasicEvent_ and _CommonEvent_ that
are ready to be used with _EventDispatcher_.

_seng-event_ also supports event capturing and bubbling phases, heavily inspired by existing event 
dispatching systems like the functionality described in the 
[DOM Event W3 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html)


## Installation

```sh
yarn add seng-event
```

```sh
npm i -S seng-event
```

## Basic usage

```ts
import EventDispatcher, {AbstractEvent} from 'seng-event';
import {generateEventTypes, EVENT_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER} from 'seng-event/lib/util/eventTypeUtils';

// extend EventDispatcher
class Foo extends EventDispatcher {
  ...
}

// Create your own event class
class FooEvent extends AbstractEvent {
   ...
   public static COMPLETE:string = EVENT_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER;
   ...
}
generateEventTypes({FooEvent});

// listener for events
const foo = new Foo();
const exampleHandler = (event:FooEvent) => 
{
  console.log('Handler called!', event.type, event.target);
}
foo.addEventListener(FooEvent.COMPLETE, exampleHandler);

// dispatch an event (will execute exampleHandler and log 'Handler called!')
foo.dispatchEvent(new FooEvent(FooEvent.COMPLETE));  
```
