# Contributing

## Adding docs

Documentation is important, so any additions or improvements are welcomed!

## Adding features

Wanting to add a feature? Awesome!

If you're not sure the feature will be accepted, you can first open an issue to
see what others think.

Otherwise, just open a PR and describe what the feature is for; what problem it
solves, why it should be added.

You should also provide tests for the new feature, so we know it's working and
to show of the usage.

At last, please update the docs, describing how this new feature can be used.

## Fixing bugs

You found a bug? How embarrassing!

If you don't know how to fix it yourself, you can open an issue describing the
bug; how to reproduce, desired behavior, actual behavior.

Otherwise, you can open a PR. Please add a test first to show the incorrect
behavior, and then add the fix so the test passes.

## Code style

Please keep the code style consistent, defined by .editorconfig and the linters
in place.
